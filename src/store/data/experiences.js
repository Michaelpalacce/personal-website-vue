In this elevated capacity, I undertook the architecting and construction of robust stage, pre-live, and live infrastructures leveraging AWS technologies, alongside Cassandra, PHP, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. Employing AWS OpsWorks and Chef for seamless server deployment, I meticulously orchestrated the setup and maintenance of critical project environments. Demonstrating proficiency in containerization, I successfully dockerized three applications, streamlining development workflows and enhancing portability. Moreover, I engineered a streamlined development environment using docker-compose, facilitating rapid setup and consistency across team members. My expertise extended into the realm of Kubernetes (K8S) orchestration, where I played a pivotal role in establishing and managing K8S clusters for project deployments. These clusters boasted advanced features including autoscaling capabilities, zero-downtime rolling updates, and robust logging and monitoring mechanisms comprising Prometheus, node-exporter, Grafana, and the EFK stack. Additionally, I honed my proficiency in Helm, packaging projects into private Helm charts for seamless deployment within Kubernetes environments. Demonstrating a commitment to robust infrastructure and security practices, I authored numerous Ansible scripts, encompassing tasks ranging from setting up Docker, Helm, and K8S binaries to configuring multi-master stacked K8S clusters and implementing cluster security measures aligned with CISecurity benchmarks. Through these initiatives, I ensured the resilience, scalability, and security posture of our project environments, contributing significantly to the overall success and efficiency of our development initiatives.'
