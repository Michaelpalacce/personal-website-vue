<p class="mt-5">
	When working with kubernetes and containers you may end up force deleting a pod. While kubernetes does say it's a bad
	idea chances are you've probably ignored it. After a while you may notice a spike in CPU usage. The perpetrator according to
	top, ps would be udisksd.

<div class=" mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">What is happening?</div>

<p class="mt-5">Essentially if you start tailing the syslog-s <span class="text-blue-400">tail -f /var/log/syslog</span>,
you will notice that there are a whole lot of errors like this:</p>


<pre><code class="my-2 language-plaintext">k3s[471]: E1102 15:11:01.933125     471 kubelet_volumes.go:245] "There were many similar errors. Turn up verbosity to see them." err="orphaned pod \"5a5fd1bf-bc3c-4600-88d3-321701d3d95a\" found, but error not a directory occurred when trying to remove the volumes dir" numErrs=2</code></pre>

<p>
	In my case I am using containerd and k3s so that's why you may see an error related to those two.
</p>

<div class=" mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">How to resolve this?</div>

<p class="mt-5">
	In order to clear this error, chances are you will need to manually delete the volume dir located at:
</p>

<pre><code class="my-2 language-plaintext">/var/lib/kubelet/pods/POD_NAME</code></pre>

<p>
	If you want to do this automatically here is a python script that tails these logs and deletes the volume dir automatically
	when it detects an error message that contains the orphaned pod message.
</p>

<pre><code class="my-2 language-python">
import subprocess
import select
import re
import shutil

f = subprocess.Popen(['tail', '-F', '/var/log/syslog'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
p = select.poll()
p.register(f.stdout)

while True:
    if p.poll(1):
        line = f.stdout.readline().decode('utf-8')
        result = re.search('orphaned pod \\\\"([0-9a-zA-Z-]*)\\\\"', line)
        if result:
            toDelete = '/var/lib/kubelet/pods/' + result.group(1)
            try:
                shutil.rmtree(toDelete)
                print(toDelete + " was deleted")
            except:
                print(toDelete + " could not be deleted")
</code></pre>

<p>This can be run by putting it on the machine that has the orphaned pods issue and running it with python3.</p>
