<div class="text-center text-4xl text-red-600">Event Request</div>

<p class="mt-5">
	EventRequest is a web framework that was designed to have zero-dependencies, have 100% test coverage and be as fast as possible.
</p>

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	So why do I care about having 0 dependencies?
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Every time I started a new project I was overwhelmed by the insane amount of dependencies almost every npm package has,
	some of them more ridiculous than the other. Since the get-go, avoiding this has been a must have, even going to the lengths
	of not splitting the package into many multiple packages like many other frameworks have done ( and for good reasons ).
	This has gone so far that when I wanted to implement a redis and memcached data server for EventRequest I had to create
	2 new packages since memcached and redis were dependencies
	( <a href="/projects#Redis%20DataServer" class="text-blue-500">Redis</a> & <a href="/projects#Memcached%20DataServer" class="text-blue-500">Memcached</a> ).

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	Tests
</p>

<p class="mt-5 text-xl font-bold text-red-500">
	100% test coverage
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	I don't think there is much to talk about here. With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc" class="text-blue-500">NYC</a>
	EventRequest has reached 100% test coverage. I think every projects should strive to have as much test coverage as possible.
	As a general policy if a new functionality has been written it is never pushed without fully testing it.

<p class="mt-5 text-xl font-bold text-red-500">
	CI/CD pipeline
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Github Actions are your friend! If you are developing an open source projects utilizing the power of Github Actions can
	save you a LOT of headaches just by adding a workflow in: {{PROEJCT_ROOT}}/.github/workflows. Lets create a file called develop.ci.yml and add it
	there:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml overflow-y-scroll h-96">
	name: develop

	on:
		push:
			branches: develop
		pull_request:
			branches: develop

	jobs:
		build:
			runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

			strategy:
				fail-fast: false
				matrix:
					node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x]
					os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

			steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v2
			- name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
			  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
			  with:
				node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
			- run: npm i
			- run: npm run build --if-present
			- run: npm test
</code></pre>

<p class="mt-2">
	Now what is happening here? Well the TL;DR is that on every push or Pull Request on the develop branch a Github Action will
	be triggered that will run 8 total workflows. It will run <pre><code class="code-plain">npm test</code></pre> on a windows and a
	linux machine for node versions <pre><code class="code-plain">12.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x</code></pre>
