<div class="text-center text-4xl text-red-600">Event Request</div>

<p class="mt-5">
	EventRequest is a web framework that was designed to have zero-dependencies, have 100% test coverage and be as fast as possible.
	Check it out on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/event_request" class="text-red-500">NPM</a>!
</p>

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	So why do I care about having 0 dependencies?
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Every time I started a new project I was overwhelmed by the insane amount of dependencies almost every npm package has,
	some of them more ridiculous than the other. Since the get-go, avoiding this has been a must have, even going to the lengths
	of not splitting the package into many multiple packages like many other frameworks have done ( and for good reasons ).
	This has gone so far that when I wanted to implement a redis and memcached data server for EventRequest I had to create
	2 new packages since memcached and redis were dependencies
	( <a href="/projects#Redis%20DataServer" class="text-blue-500">Redis</a> & <a href="/projects#Memcached%20DataServer" class="text-blue-500">Memcached</a> ).

	Tests
</p>

<p class="mt-5 text-xl font-bold text-red-500">
	100% test coverage
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	I don't think there is much to talk about here. With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc" class="text-blue-500">NYC</a>
	EventRequest has reached 100% test coverage. I think every projects should strive to have as much test coverage as possible.
	As a general policy if a new functionality has been written it is never pushed without fully testing it.

<p class="mt-5 text-xl font-bold text-red-500">
	CI/CD pipeline
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Github Actions are your friend! If you are developing an open source projects utilizing the power of Github Actions can
	save you a LOT of headaches just by adding a workflow in: {{PROEJCT_ROOT}}/.github/workflows. Lets create a file called develop.ci.yml and add it
	there:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml overflow-y-scroll h-96">
	name: develop

	on:
		push:
			branches: develop
		pull_request:
			branches: develop

	jobs:
		build:
			runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

			strategy:
				fail-fast: false
				matrix:
					node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x]
					os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

			steps:
				- uses: actions/checkout@v2
				- name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
				  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
				  with:
					node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
				- run: npm i
				- run: npm run build --if-present
				- run: npm test
</code></pre>

<p class="mt-2 font-bold text-red-500">
	TL;DR
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	On every push or Pull Request on the develop branch a Github Action will be triggered that will run 8 total
	workflows. It will run <pre><code class="code-plain">npm test</code></pre> on a windows and a
	linux machine for node versions <pre><code class="code-plain">12.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x</code></pre>
</p>

<p class="mt-2 font-bold text-red-500">
	In Depth
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Every workflow start with a name section that will be used by Github to well... name your action. After it we have the
	conditional section. In the case of either a push or a pull request opened on the develop branch this github action will be triggered.
	<pre>
	<code class="language-yaml">
		name: develop
		on:
			push:
				branches: develop
			pull_request:
				branches: develop
	</code>
	</pre>
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	<pre>
	<code class="language-yaml">
		runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
		strategy:
			fail-fast: false
			matrix:
				node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 15.x, 16.x]
				os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
	</code>
	</pre>
	By defining a matrix, it allows us to run this github action multiple times with different parameters. First thing here
	will be the <span class="bg-gray-600">runs-on</span> which will cause the Github Action to be triggered twice, once with <span class="bg-gray-600">ubuntu-latest</span>
	and once with <span class="bg-gray-600">windows-latest</span>. Since I want to run tests on both linux and windows,
	this is good enough for me. The <span class="bg-gray-600">node-version</span> parameter will come in play next.

	<pre>
	<code class="language-yaml">
	steps:
		- uses: actions/checkout@v2
		- name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
		  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
		  with:
			node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
		- run: npm i
		- run: npm run build --if-present
		- run: npm test
	</code>
	</pre>
	The steps section define a YAML array of everything we want to do in order. If any of these steps returns a non-zero code
	then the action will be considered as failed. Since Github Actions has an amazing marketplace
	of actions and a bunch of native actions, we will use some of them here. Namely the <span class="bg-gray-600">actions/checkout@v2</span>
	will checkout the project and the <span class="bg-gray-600">actions/setup-node@v1</span> will install NodeJS and NPM.
	Notice here that we use <span class="bg-gray-600">uses</span> to run specific actions,
	whereas down a bit we use <span class="bg-gray-600">run</span> which will run commands. Since we want to run
	tests on all the <span class="bg-gray-600">node-version</span> we've defined, in the second step we use <span class="bg-gray-600">with</span>
	to pass them.
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	At the end we will have tests that will be ran on windows and linux for node versions 12,14,15,16.

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	Documentation
</p>

<p class="mt-5">
	While the documentation is not structured in different pages, I've tried to write as much documentation as possible.
	Every single component, behaviour, plugin, etc. is documented. All of the documentation can be found in the README.md
	file in the project. The documentation is planned to be moved in a more organized structure either on Github deployments
	or perhaps my site.
</p>

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	Customization
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Customization and extensibility have always been the main goal of this web framework. Most of the functionality of the
	framework is actually in the form of plug-ins that can be added.
</p>

<p class="mt-2 font-bold text-red-500">
	Components
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Generally Components are pieces of the framework that can be used outside of it. Like an in memory cache, validation tools,
	some security components, etc.
	For example if you want to use the LeakyBucket implementation of the framework, you can do so:
	<pre class="m-2"><code class="language-js">const LeakyBucket = require( 'event_request/server/components/rate_limiter/bucket' );</code></pre>
</p>

<p class="mt-2 font-bold text-red-500">
	Plugins
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	Plug-ins are components that can be added to the server like: <pre class="m-2"><code class="language-js">server.apply( PluginInterfaceObject ||'pluginId', options )</code></pre>
	These plugins usually add some form of new functionality to the EventRequest object, or alternatively are responsible
	for some pre or post processing ( like handling form data or logging ).
	Some plug-ins are also dependent on other plug-ins, which need to be setup beforehand.
</p>

<p class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">
	Speed
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	The main project of this framework has always been speed. Currently the project is in a state where not many new features
	are going to be added. Bugfixes are always going to be prioritized but if there are none, then speed is something that
	is always going to be top priority. The end goal would always be to be as fast as the fastest frameworks and as close to
	not having a framework boilerplate and slowdown as possible. In the future many of the components, features and plug-ins
	will be remodelled so they are called only if 100% needed.
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	If your site isn't fast, users will not have the patience to stay, so we need the backend to be lighting fast in everything it is going to do.
	Speed also means that we can service more clients at once using as little resources as possible.
</p>

<p class="mt-2">
	While the base functionality of EventRequest is blazing fast with almost no slowdown compared to a base HTTP server, even
	with routing implemented on the side of the framework, some of the plug-ins do introduce a significant slowdown, but
	I am always pushing forward towards improving them.
