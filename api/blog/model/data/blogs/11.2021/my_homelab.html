<p class="mt-5">
	The last few months I have gotten myself into HomeLabbing. Started off by purchasing 2 Raspberry PI 4s 8GB, and ended up
	with a new router, 2 more Raspberry PIs and 4 SSDs with enclosures. It's been a long journey, a lot of optimizations, improvements
	issues, issues and more issues. There is still a LOT of work to do but I have gotten to a point where I am pretty satisfied
	with what I have to share. At the end of the blog, if you feel like you want to give it a try, you can head on to my
	github repo and get some ideas.

<div class=" mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">Why a raspberry PI?</div>

<p>
	It's cheap, energy efficient and has a small footprint. It will be slow, you will have to create images specifically for
	arm if you are using docker, and some times things just won't work as you want them to, but that is ok. If I need something beefier
	and more reliable I will end up spending way more than I currently have for the Pis, not to mention the size and energy bill.
</p>

<div class=" mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">Starting off</div>

<p>
	Initially while starting off I had 2 Raspberry pis and decided to setup K8S on them with Longhorn as a CSI driver and
	calico as a CNI ( after failing to setup flannel for 24 hours ) and after a while I finally managed to get my first
	service up and running ( grafana-prometheus monitoring suite ). Things worked... for whole 10 minutes. I've already made several mistakes
	without even knowing it. So lets start listing all of them.
</p>


<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-xl text-blue-500 font-bold">SD Cards</div>
<p>
	Now since I do not have a NAS or other form of Storage that my kubernetes cluster can utilize I decided giving
	<a href="https://longhorn.io/" class="text-blue-400">Longhorn.io</a> a shot. Now Longhorn ... has it's issues but
	overall is amazing. It is very fast, supports replication, backups and has good disaster recovery. Problem was my setup...
	Longhorn had to use SLOW sd cards to read data and in some cases send it over to the other node, as it is distributed.
	This resulted in my services having to wait <span class="text-red-500" title="A REALLY LONG TIME">A LONG TIME</span> for IO.
	This was not OK. The solution to this was SSDs. But the issues do not stop here :).
</p>

<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-xl text-blue-500 font-bold">SSDs and enclosures</div>

<p>
	Now I want to start by saying, yes I know there is such a thing as an external SSD. Why did I not use it?
</p>
<p>
	So anyway, SSDs and enclosures. I ended up purchasing 2 Kingston A400s 240GB SSDs with 2 SSD enclosures. Now the SSDs were absolutely fine,
	problem was the enclosures. Turns out there is a thing called TRIM and UASP. They are kind of connected but essentially the
	issue was that the some SSD enclosures ( and SSDs for that matter ) don't follow the UASP protocols correctly, resulting in it essentially not working on Raspberry Pis.
	Booting up that should have taken a few seconds, ended up taking around 20 minutes, and the OS after would be insanely slow.
	This... SUCKS... it took me 2 days to figure it out, but essentially the steps for it are documented on my HomeLab
	<a href="https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/HomeLab#my-ssd-drive-has-uas-and-its-not-letting-me-boot" class="text-blue-400">github page</a>.
</p>

<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-xl text-blue-500 font-bold">Networking... issues continue</div>
<p>
	Now me being a noob my idea was ... so what if it's wifi connected to my 5Ghz wifi, hidden in the storage that essentially
	has 1/5 bars of signal? Well... shocker there is an issue. I ended up buying a second router like my main one and creating
	a mesh system using Asus's AI-Mesh system and connected my raspberry pis in it with a Gigabit connection.
	Now FINALLY they were connected with a gigabit connection between each other, reading from and writing to SSDs. We finally got the speeds we wanted!
	WRONG!
</p>

<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-xl text-blue-500 font-bold">K8S Sucks! Long live K3S</div>
<p>
	K8s is great, problem with it is that it is meant to run on enterprise grade servers and a raspberry pi is not that.
	It ended up eating too WAY TOO MANY resources, that my setup did not have then. K3s on the other hand is essentially the same
	as K8S with a lighter footprint. I ended up having to take down my entire infrastructure and redoing everything.
	And finally we are done. Sorta...
</p>

<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-xl text-blue-500 font-bold">K3S and Longhorn overhead</div>

<p>
	Having an orchestrator with all the fancy probes to check if services are running and distributed storage is great...
	except when it is not. The performance overhead was immense and it was way more than my 2 PIs could handle. CPU was capped almost all the time
	and I could barely control my cluster as I had to use my master/control-plane node. In the end I had to get 2 more Raspberry PIs. Finally I had enough
	power to do what I want
</p>

<div class="mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">What now?</div>

<p>
	HomeLabbing and self-hosting is not efficient. It is scary. It is hard. Issues arise all the time. You do not save money. It's expensive when starting.
	You do not save time. You have to setup backups. You are responsible for your data corrupting ( it did happen once yes ). But it is hella fun.
	The things you can learn just by spinning up a Linux server and having to configure it is immense. It is challenging, but when it works
	it feels good. You learn things all the time, you get better at solving issues. Nothing beats hands on experience.
	It's a hobby like any other!
</p>

<div class=" mt-10 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">Benefits?</div>
<p>
	There are a lot of them. Taking control of your data. Hosting software that you cannot find online due to it being open source
	and offered as is most cases. Learning. It's fun!
</p>

<div class=" mt-5 text-center text-4xl text-blue-600 font-bold">Should I do it too?</div>

<p>
	If you are asking yourself this question then... no. Don't do it. I would personally suggest it to everyone but
	I don't think many will listen. After all... why do you want to self-host? I started off doing this to learn and to
	have a media server that I can use to provide entertainment to my family.
</p>

<p>
	There is an exception tho. I would say if you are a SysAdmin or a DevOps dude, then yeah go ahead! You really should do this.
